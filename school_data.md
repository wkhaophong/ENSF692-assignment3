Screenshot 3: The program's error handling was tested by entering an invalid school code and an invalid school name. The program responded correctly by prompting for re-entry of the input. Upon entering a valid school name, a school with a NaN value for enrollment was selected. The program handled the NaN value appropriately and calculated the median value of enrollments. The result correctly showed no enrollments over 500, adhering to the requirements.
